AI Face Detection Web App

This project implements a biometric login system using face recognition. It captures a live image from a webcam via face-api.js, detects the user’s face, and computes a unique descriptor. This descriptor is then compared to pre-registered descriptors—generated from multiple images per user—to determine a match based on a predefined Euclidean distance threshold.
